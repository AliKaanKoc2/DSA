## üìù Overview
This project investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global online shopping demand, focusing on fluctuations in purchasing behavior across various product categories. By analyzing daily purchase quantities and their sales values, the study aims to reveal how consumer behavior shifted during the pandemic period. The comparison between pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic phases will help determine whether the alterations in online shopping demand were temporary responses to lockdown restrictions or a longer-term shift in online consumer habits.

## üîç **Research Question & Sub-Questions**

**Research Question:**
How did global online shopping demand and category-level purchasing behavior change across the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods of COVID-19?


**Sub-Questions**
- Did online shopping demand rise significantly during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period?
- Which product categories experienced the strongest fluctuations in daily demand during lockdown restrictions?
- Which countries showed the strongest rebound in online shopping demand after the pandemic period, and how does this compare to their pre-pandemic levels?
- Is the presence of lockdown restrictions associated with noticeable changes in daily online shopping demand?
- Did online demand remain permanently above pre-pandemic levels after restrictions were lifted?
- Can patterns in daily demand help distinguish between essential and non-essential product categories?

## ‚úÖ Hypothesis

**Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**
There is no significant difference in daily online shopping demand between the pre-pandemic and pandemic periods.

**Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**  
Daily online shopping demand increased significantly during the pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period.

A statistical significance threshold of Œ± = 0.05 will be used when evaluating the p-value for hypothesis testing.

## üéØ **Project Goal**
The aim of this project is to examine the impact of the pandemic on online shopping demand across multiple product categories and countries. The project compares teh periods before,during, and after the pandemic to measure changes in consumer demand over time and to determine which product categories have experienced the most significant shifts. It also examines the influence of lockdown restrictions on demand fluctuations and evaluates whether online shopping behavior remained elevated after restrictions ended. The results will be supported with visual analysis, statistical testing, and machine learning models to give a clearer picture of how digital shopping habits were altered during this period.
