## üìù Overview
This project investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global online shopping demand, focusing on fluctuations in purchasing behavior across various product categories. By analyzing daily purchase quantities and their sales values, the study aims to reveal how consumer behavior shifted during the pandemic period. The comparison between pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic phases will help determine whether the alterations in online shopping demand were temporary responses to lockdown restrictions or a longer-term shift in online consumer habits.
